# CardBoard
___

Welcome to CardBoard! CardBoard is a fully interactive, digital to-do list. In other words, this is an attempted clone of Trello, without all of the cool features that Trello provides! CardBoard is the result of my final project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. 

___

### Why?
---

I wanted to make an app that I can see myself improving and even using over time. I wanted to take a model, Trello, that has a lot of UX/UI properties and see if I could test myself in building something interactive using Express and EJS. I was also encouraged to use Express/EJS only for this project in order to implement drag and drop components later.

### Technologies Used
---

Express.js, Node.js, Sequelize, Postgres, EJS, HTML5, CSS, Javascript
